        I'm Carson Pawlyshyn, a sophomore majoring in Information Management and Technology.
         My curiosity lies in the intersection of business and technology, driven by my desire to
        contribute to the fashion industry post-graduation. Recently, I interned as a data and business analyst,
        refining my analytical skills in a real-world context. Beyond academics and work, I enjoy traveling,
        attending concerts, fashion, reading, and trying new restaurants with friends.
        These experiences enrich my outlook and drive my ambitions. As I progress through my academic journey, 
        I look forward to translating my passions into meaningful contributions.
