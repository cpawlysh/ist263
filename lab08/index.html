        <p>
            I'm Carson Pawlyshyn, a sophomore majoring in Information Management and Technology.
            My curiosity lies in the intersection of business and technology, driven by my desire to
            contribute to the fashion industry <br> post-graduation.

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
            Recently, I interned as a data and business analyst,
            refining my analytical skills in a real-world context. Beyond academics and work, I enjoy traveling,
            attending concerts, fashion, reading, and trying new restaurants with friends.
            These experiences enrich my outlook and drive my ambitions. As I progress through my academic journey, 
            I look forward to translating my passions into <strong>meaningful contributions.</strong>
